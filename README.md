OpenCV

PyTorch

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/excavator-parts-detection.git
cd excavator-parts-detection
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download or prepare your dataset and structure it according to YOLO format.

Train or test the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
yolo task=detect mode=train data=your_data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
Usage
Training: Train the model with your custom excavator parts dataset.

Inference: Run the trained model on new images to detect and classify parts.

Cataloging: Save and organize the detected parts with their labels and metadata for inventory management.

Dataset
Custom-labeled dataset following YOLOv8 standards. (You can replace this with a public link if you want to share.)
